DAT IMAGE DATABASE FILE FORMAT (DMG 3.0 - Atari)
================================================

This is the result of my investigations about the PART1.DAT file format. It's important
to know that my investigations took place to try to create files wihout DMG for the 
Atari ST and Amiga target, thus there is no information here for other databases like the
one for Amstrad PCW or those for the original DOS interpreter. The PCW one may be examined
later though, the DOS one is not of my interest since PCDAAD exists. Uto, 2022.

The file has a header with the following format. Please notice all values are 
little endian:

Offset   Content
------   -------
00-01    Version (0x0300 value for  DMG 3)
02-03    Screen mode: 0000 = LOW_RES (that seems yo be the ST/Amiga). Mabe you 
         can also find decimal 13 for EGA and 4 for CGA, but this has not been
         checked.
04-05    Number of locations. 
06-09    File size.
0A-3009  The location info area, which is a zone of 256 blocks of 48 bytes, one per 
         location, defined below. There are allways 256 blocks, no matter how 
         many locations there are.

The location info blocks
========================

Each location info block is defined like this:

Offset   Content
------   -------
00-03    Offset of image data in the file
04-05    Flags: see below
06-07    X coord the graphic is fixed, 0x0000 otherwise.
08-09    Y coord the graphic is fixed, 0x0000 otherwise.
0A       First palette value to be applied in fixed graphics (0x00 default), 0x00 otherwise.
0B       First palette value to be applied in fixed graphics (0x0F default), 0xFF otherwise.
0C-2B    The palette, 32 bytes (see below)
2C-2F    This is related to CGA palette, but how to use is unknown at this moment.

The flags field
===============
The field is a bitwise field, this is the meaning of the bits:

Bit 0: set to 1 for float images, 0 for fixed
Bit 1: set to 1 for buffered, 0 not buffered
Bit 2: old source code defines it as CGAP01, no idea what it is for but DMGv3 allways sets to 1.
Bit 3: old source code defines it as HOTSP. No idea what it is for, DMGv3 sets to 0.
Bit 4: old sources defines it as SAMPLE. I assume that it tells the content is no image but SFX.

The palette
===========
The palette is in the usual AtariST format, that is, 16 pairs of words with the following meaning:

xxxxxRRR xGGGxBBB

Please notice DMGv3 is able o also add the EGA equivalence color at the first 4 bits, but I have
not gone if dept about that as as said above, I have no interest in old DOS interpreter support at
this point. It would be like this:

EEEExRRR xGGGxBBB


The image data
==============
Each of the locations who has been initialized in the location info blocks will have their image
data located at the offset specified by that information. There you can find the image header 
data, followed by the image data itself.

The image header:

Offset   Content
------   -------
00-01    Width. If block is compressed, msb will be set to 1. i.e. 00 20 means (0x20 width, 
         32 width, not compressed, while 80 20 means 32 width, compressed)
02-03    Height
04-05    Data size. 

After the header, there comes the compressed of uncompressed image data.
